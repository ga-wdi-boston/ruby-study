## Type Conversion

Write the Ruby code that takes the integer `700` and returns the string `"007"`.

```ruby
700.to_s
```

## Array Manipulation

Write the Ruby code that takes the following array, `[23, 56, 3, 7]`, and
manipulates it by sorting it and then reversing it in place (i.e., modifying the
reference to the original).

```ruby
[23, 56, 3, 7].sort.reverse
```

## Class#method!

What does an exclamation point after a method usually signify?  e.g.,
`my_string.capitalize!`

```md
A bang at the end of a method name usually signifies that it will permantly alter the object it's called on.
```

## Instantiation
How do you create an instance of a class in Ruby?

```ruby
Class.new
```

[Ruby Docs](http://ruby-doc.org/core-2.3.1/Class.html)

## Class Modification

If a class in Ruby gets modified while there are existing instances of it, then
will those instances also have those modifications?

```md
Yes. The existing instances of the class will also be updated.
```

I used `irb` to test this myself.

```ruby
irb(main):032:0> class Stuff
irb(main):033:1>  def do_math(x,y)
irb(main):034:2>    x * y
irb(main):035:2>  end
irb(main):036:1> end
=> :do_math
irb(main):037:0> my_stuff = Stuff.new
=> #<Stuff:0x007f81500300d8>
irb(main):038:0> my_stuff.do_math(3,5)
=> 15
irb(main):039:0> class Stuff
irb(main):040:1>  def do_math(x,y)
irb(main):041:2>    x + y
irb(main):042:2>  end
irb(main):043:1> end
=> :do_math
irb(main):044:0> my_stuff.do_math(3,5)
=> 8
```

## Iteration

Write an example of iteration in Ruby.

```ruby
[1,2,3,4].each do |num|
  num + 5
end
```
